##Description##

Grokkie is a web application to help users remember and share the resources
they have used to 'grok' (or in other words, truly understand) a certain 
subject.  A collection of these resources is known as a 'Roadmap.'  Roadmaps 
are a clear route to grokking a certain skill, with each resource being a stop
along the way.

Current categories that are available in Grokkie include Programming, Fitness,
Cooking, Languages, Sciences, Math, and Crafts.

Within those categories, are a number of 'Skills,' such as Javascript, Ruby, 
Chemistry, and Algebra.
